\title{GRIM-U Forensic Consistency Check}
\usage{
grimu_check(
  n1,
  n2,
  u_reported = NA_real_,
  comparison = "equal",
  p_reported,
  digits,
  rounding = NULL,
  p_min = NULL,
  p_max = NULL,
  alternative = "two.sided"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n1}{Integer. Sample size of group 1.}

\item{n2}{Integer. Sample size of group 2.}

\item{u_reported}{Numeric, optional. The reported U statistic. If NA, checks P-value consistency only.}

\item{comparison}{Character. "equal" (default) or "less_than" (for reported inequalities like "p < .05").}

\item{p_reported}{Numeric. The reported p-value.}

\item{digits}{Integer. The number of decimal places the p-value was reported to. Mandatory if p_reported is supplied.}

\item{rounding}{Character vector, optional. Allowed rounding methods: "round", "trunc", "up".
If NULL, defaults to c("round", "trunc").}

\item{p_min}{Numeric, optional. Manually override the lower bound of the p-value search window.}

\item{p_max}{Numeric, optional. Manually override the upper bound of the p-value search window.}

\item{alternative}{Character. One of "two.sided", "less", or "greater". Defaults to "two.sided".}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{summary}{A single-row tibble with the overall consistency verdict (\code{consistent}), component checks
(\code{u_bounds_consistent}, \code{u_matches_p}, \code{p_granularity_consistent}), and diagnostic flags.}
\item{details}{A tibble of all candidate U values found within the p-value search window,
showing which specific formula(s) matched the reported p-value.}
}
\description{
Checks the mathematical consistency of reported Mann-Whitney U test results.
Performs a "Triangulation" check across Sample Sizes (N), Test Statistic (U), and P-value (P).
}
\details{
\enumerate{
\item N <-> U: Is the reported U physically possible? (Bounds & Granularity).
\item N <-> P: Is the reported P mathematically possible? (Grid search of attainable p-values).
\item U <-> P: Does the specific reported U generate the reported P?
}
