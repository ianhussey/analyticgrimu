\title{Check Consistency of Mann-Whitney U Statistic with Sample Sizes}
\usage{
check_u_consistency(n1, n2, u_reported)
}
\arguments{
\item{n1}{Integer. Sample size of group 1.}

\item{n2}{Integer. Sample size of group 2.}

\item{u_reported}{Numeric. The reported U statistic to check.}
}
\value{
A single-row tibble containing:
\item{u_bounds_consistent}{Logical. TRUE if 0 <= U <= n1*n2.}
\item{u_granularity_consistent}{Logical. TRUE if U is an integer or half-integer.}
\item{u_possible}{Logical. TRUE if both checks pass.}
}
\description{
Verifies if a reported U statistic is mathematically possible given the group sample sizes.
Checks two properties:
\enumerate{
\item Bounds: U must be between 0 and n1 * n2.
\item Granularity: U must be an integer (no ties) or half-integer (with ties).
}
}
